# My Simple To-Do List App

I've just completed a beginner-friendly project where I created a simple To-Do List application using React. This project helped me get started with building a basic web application.

## Getting Started

To run this project on my local machine, I followed these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before I began, I made sure I had the following installed on my computer:

- Node.js: I downloaded it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Dependencies

1. I cloned this repository to my local machine using `git clone`.
git clone https://github.com/jencegram/react_forms_2.git

2. I navigated to the project directory.
cd simple-todo-list-react

I installed the project dependencies.
npm install

### Running the Application

Once I installed the dependencies, I ran the To-Do List app:
npm start

This command started the development server, and I viewed the app by opening my web browser and going to http://localhost:3000.

### Running Tests

This project includes tests to make sure everything is working correctly. I ran the tests with the following command:
npm test
